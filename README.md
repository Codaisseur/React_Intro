* Do recap with kahoot

## Intro
**_Introducing students to the idea of a single page application, discuss advantages_**

## Workshop I: An optimized clock
**_Building a clock in vanilla JS, according to 4 steps, while introducing students to the developer/computer friendly paradox, that what is nice for a computer, is not always nice for a developer, and vica versa._**

Make sure the following steps end up on the white board
* **Step 1: What are you going to build?**
    - Draw end product on white board
* **Step 2: Research the info you need**
    - Ask students: what do you need? (HTML, CSS, JS, getElementById, Date())
    - Give students some time to gather some info on getElementById, Date()
    - Gather info on white board, make sure getHours(), getMinutes(), getSeconds() is there, show why time is not useful
* **Step 3: Write your plan in English**
    - For JS: I need to display the time (so get the hours, minutes and seconds and add them to an elements) and update that time everyone second
    - As for CSS: You want different colors for hours, minutes and seconds and they should be next to each other
    - HTML: following from the above, you probably want a `<div>` for clock (for flexbox), a `<div>` for hours, minutes and seconds each, and colons to separate them.
* **Step 4: Write your Code**


* Let students create the clock, after live code an example
* Let students create optimized clock in groups, after live code an example
* Show the difference of the optimized and not opimized clock, show how that is problematic in the wave (fastest speed)
* Explain the problem: code that is easy to read & maintain is not always nice to your browser, code that is good for the browser is not always friendly for the developer.
